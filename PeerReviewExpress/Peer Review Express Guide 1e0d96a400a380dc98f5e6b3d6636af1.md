# Peer Review Express Guide

## **📌Purpose of Operation**

To improve the previous Peer Review system, we are introducing the **Peer Review Express program**. This system allows team members to recognize and document positive contributions more frequently and clearly, while encouraging each other’s growth and collaboration.

## 1️⃣ How It Works

1. **From ‘Peer Review’ → To ‘Peer Review Express’**
    - This system enables team members to recognize and record collaboration and contributions in real time.
2. **Operated at anytime**
    - Peer Review Express is not conducted monthly, but rather on a **daily/event basis.**
    - Daily submissions are not mandatory. Instead, we encourage you to submit a survey whenever a team member makes a positive contribution.
3. **Multiple Submissions Allowed**
    - You can submit multiple reviews per day.
4. **Review Items and RP Points**
    - You can refer to the definitions, descriptions, and RP (Review Point) for each review item at the bottom of this page.
5. **Reviewers Also Earn RP**
    1. **Survey Format**
        - Each review form consists of the following three items:
            
            ① Select the teammate you want to review
            
            ② **Write specific feedback(5W1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How))  in a descriptive format (within 2 sentences) + link**
            
    - When you submit a review, you will automatically earn **2 RP** as a reviewer.

## 📚 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1. Will there be any penalty if I don’t write daily?

→ No penalty, but also no advantage either! Peer Review Express is a voluntary program, but we strongly encourage you to recognize and record your teammates when you notice positive contributions. Regular participation helps build team culture and also benefits your RP accumulation.

### Q2. Can I submit multiple reviews for the same person?

→ Yes, you can submit multiple reviews for the same teammate as long as they are submitted through separate forms.

### Q3. What makes a good review?

→ Good reviews focus on specific actions and the positive impact they had on the team or yourself. Please match your feedback to the appropriate review category.

### Q4. Can I still receive review points if my role involves little collaboration?

→ Yes. Roles with less collaboration (e.g., research, attending seminars—Growth items) may result in fewer reviews or RP in the short term. However, these items carry higher weight in evaluation, so performance is not necessarily rated lower in the long run. That said, if collaboration-related metrics remain consistently low over time, individual performance will be examined more closely.

### Q5. Do I need to write feedback on a daily basis?

→ No. Reviewers don’t distinguish between “daily” and “weekly” feedback. You can leave express feedback anytime based on a week’s worth of output. There’s no need to strictly stick to same-day reviews.

### Q6. Is it disadvantageous to work alone or asynchronously?

→ Not at all. Even if you’re not working in a synchronized time zone, as long as you share your output clearly and collaborate asynchronously, you can receive meaningful feedback. The system accommodates diverse working styles.

### Q7. I’m focused on solo work and barely getting any feedback. What should I do?

→ If you’re contributing individually, it’s important to proactively request feedback from your project lead or collaborators. Regularly sharing your progress and touch points with the team will help increase your reviews and RP.

### Q8. Does peer review actually help with motivation?

→ Yes. Some team members reported that the Peer Review Express system boosts motivation by enabling instant feedback. The ease and speed of giving and receiving feedback has been especially helpful.
