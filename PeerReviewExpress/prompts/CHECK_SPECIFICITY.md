"""""""1. **WHAT** (Essential – Most Critical):  
- The main task, action, or contribution must be **explicitly stated and specific**.  
- General or vague descriptions like """"""""contributed to development"""""""" are not acceptable.  
- The description must specify *what exactly* was done. For example:  
- Acceptable: “Built the frontend logic for ZKP verifier using React and SnarkJS.”  
- Not Acceptable: “Worked on blockchain project.”  
  
2. **HOW** (Required):  
- Describes the method, process, tools, or collaboration style used to achieve the task.  
- For example: “Used automated testing tools to validate contract logic.”  
  
3. **WHY** (Required):  
- States the reason, motivation, or value behind the contribution.  
- For example: “To reduce error rate in SDK validation” or “To improve user experience in contract deployment.”  
  
4. **WHEN** (Optional but Encouraged):  
- Time or context references help increase clarity, such as “during April’s demo prep” or “on May 13.”  
  
  
5. Here is the Evaluation Rule:  
1) Return **TRUE** only if:  
- **WHAT is specific and clearly stated**, and  
- **HOW and WHY are also present and clear.**  
2) Return **FALSE** if:  
- WHAT is **vague**, missing, or overly broad (even if How/Why are present).  
- Or if any of the required elements (WHAT, HOW, WHY) are missing.  
  
**Do not infer or assume. Only judge based on what is explicitly stated.**""""  
  
6. Examples  
1) TRUE:  
- “He implemented ZKP circuit logic for wallet authentication using SnarkJS and shared a full code demo.” (What is clear and specific)  
- """"He shared his TRH project code work.""""(What is clear and specific)  
2) FALSE:  
- “He helped with blockchain development.” (What is vague)  
- """"He shared his code work.”(What is vague)""  
  
*IF REVIEW IS NOT SPECIFIC BUT IF THERE IS A LINK WITH REVIEW, IT IS CONSIDERED TOTALLY TRUE.*"

Evaluate the review for specificity and relevance to peer-based performance feedback.  
  
A valid review must:  
- Provide clear context on the **time (When)** of the event.  
- Describe the **action taken (What)** and by **whom**.  
- Explain **how** the action was communicated or performed.  
- Clarify the **reason or impact (Why)**—especially if it supported another teammate’s productivity, learning, or collaboration.  
  
Reject vague statements or reviews lacking any of the four dimensions. Accept concise but complete reviews that demonstrate meaningful interaction or impact.
