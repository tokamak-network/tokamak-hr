[1] This week, he completed two key tests using real ZK proofs (Real ZKP): a Fault Dispute Game test [2] and a Batch Scaling test [3]. He also analyzed research on ZK proving costs by EVM opcode [4], provided feedback via Notion comments on Eugenie’s whitepaper work [5], and shared his thoughts on Harvey’s Advanced Slashing design proposal. [6] &gt;  &gt; Bernard validated the real-world deployability of OP Succinct through an evidence-driven approach. From Real ZK mode testing, he derived a concrete cost estimate of *under $0.005 per transaction*, and clearly laid out next steps: producing a more accurate per-transaction cost estimate, developing a practical estimation methodology for real deployment, researching a cost/time-optimized hybrid approach with the bisection game, and reflecting the ZKP integration plan in the plan/whitepaper. In his EVM opcode cost analysis, he surfaced an important insight: operations such as *precompiles* can have a high real *time cost* relative to their *gas cost*. [4] From a collaboration standpoint, he made a strategic suggestion to describe the approach in a more general way in the whitepaper rather than referencing a specific product name (e.g., Succinct), [7] and helped set up a seminar plan on ZK fraud proof mechanisms. [8] &gt;  &gt; Bernard demonstrated a structured, collaborative working style. After completing complex technical tests, he went beyond simply sharing results—he documented them in detailed reports and proposed concrete next steps, ensuring continuity for the project. He actively provided feedback on teammates’ work and contributed to overall quality, and he showed an intention to raise the team’s technical understanding by sharing his research through a seminar. He also balanced technical depth with strategic thinking, such as recommending a careful approach to product naming in the whitepaper. &gt;  &gt; Bernard’s Real ZK mode testing became a meaningful milestone in validating OP Succinct’s feasibility for production deployment. The concrete cost data (under $0.005 per transaction) provides a foundation for evaluating economic viability, while the clear roadmap gives direction for continued research. The EVM opcode cost analysis can inform prioritization for future protocol optimization, and the notably high time cost of precompiles is a key insight to consider for ZK-aware gas design. The planned seminar is expected to improve team-wide understanding of ZK fraud proof mechanisms and enable broader contribution to whitepaper writing and technical decision-making. &gt;  &gt; *[1] Research on integrating a Prover Market with the OP Stack using OP Succinct* &gt; <https://tokamak-network.slack.com/archives/C07JU6K4KDY/p1738222865019719> &gt; *[2] Fault Dispute Game test* &gt; <https://www.notion.so/tokamak/OP-Succinct-Real-Mode-Dispute-Game-Challenge-Test-Report-1a8d9a400a238004b54cca05eb7e5c94> &gt; *[3] Batch Scaling test* &gt; <https://www.notion.so/tokamak/OP-Succinct-Batch-Scaling-Test-Report-1a8d9a400a23800eb4b0eca5bc8fab50> &gt; *[4] Analysis of ZK proving cost research by EVM opcode* &gt; <https://tokamak-network.slack.com/archives/C07JU6K4KDY/p1738222912662359> &gt; *[5] Feedback via Notion comments on Eugenie’s whitepaper work* &gt; <https://www.notion.so/tokamak/TAIKO-preconfs-and-PBS-18bd9a400a2380b28a36fc70e1b72c7e?pvs=4#18cd9a400a2380e38dbcf0c8e9e52036> &gt; *[6] Thoughts on Harvey’s Advanced Slashing design proposal* &gt; <https://tokamak-network.slack.com/archives/C084C0RC81E/p1738215479806199?thread_ts=1738215479.806199&amp;cid=C084C0RC81E> &gt; *[7] Strategic suggestion to describe a general approach in the whitepaper* &gt; <https://tokamak-network.slack.com/archives/C084C0RC81E/p1738215600330929?thread_ts=1738215600.330929&amp;cid=C084C0RC81E> &gt; *[8] Seminar plan on ZK fraud proof mechanisms* &gt; <https://tokamak-network.slack.com/archives/C084C0RC81E/p1738232395980699?thread_ts=1738232395.980699&amp;cid=C084C0RC81E>    Your dedicated feedback has helped *Peer Review Express* grow stronger. • *Peer Review Express <https://forms.gle/7a3TTaVnWogG3wnAA/[Link]>*     ◦ *Notion Guide <https://www.notion.so/tokamak/Speedy-Peer-Review-Guide-1e0d96a400a380dc98f5e6b3d6636af1/[Link]>* • *Peer Review Feedback <https://forms.gle/JepgEQMDYjeB8aGf6/[Link]>*    We look forward to your continuous support and proactive participation! :raised_hands: Thank you. | 2.0 | False |

| 2026-02-02 08:34:36.015000 | tokamak-dev | Today, with Jason’s help, I set up *Claude Code on my laptop.*  I exported last week’s GitHub activity from ATI (All Thing Eye) as a CSV, then used Claude Code to write analysis scripts and build a simple HTML report as a web page.  The funny part is I’m not a developer, but with Claude Code I finished roughly 1,100 lines of code in about 10 minutes. Of course, the quality is still beginner-level, but considering I couldn’t write a single line of code just a month ago, it felt pretty meaningful.  We have many much stronger developers on our team, so I think if we use this environment properly, the gap in speed and quality can grow even more. It also made me realize I should start studying development more seriously.  I’m also sharing the small files I made as an attachment. And going forward, if I have questions, I’ll actively ask the dev team and learn from you all.  Big thanks again to <@U087WJHRVEW> :pray: | 5.0 | True |
