Now available immediately via a distributed installer without a separate build process, the extension offers project-specific AI chat, auto-completion, and direct file editing.  • Repository: <https://github.com/tokamak-network/tokamak-ai-agent>  • Latest Release: <https://github.com/tokamak-network/tokamak-ai-agent/releases/tag/v0.1.0/v0.1.0> (VSIX installer provided)  • Documentation: <https://github.com/tokamak-network/tokamak-ai-agent/blob/main/README.md/README.md> (English), <https://github.com/tokamak-network/tokamak-ai-agent/blob/main/README_KR.md/README_KR.md> (Korean) includes installation and detailed guides. Problem &amp; Goals • Problem      ◦ Difficulty using the Tokamak Qwen model.      ◦ Inconvenience in integrating internal AI models with external AI tools.      ◦ Inconvenience in development when using API calls using Python.      ◦ Reduced productivity and potential for errors when manually applying AI-suggested code to source files.      ◦ Imbalance in response quality due to use of non-standardized prompts.  • Goals      ◦ Increased use of the Tokamak Qwen model.      ◦ Maintaining development flow through integrated chat and real-time Ghost Text autocompletion within the IDE.      ◦ Precise code context transfer through @mentions and project structure recognition.      ◦ Establishing a secure automated environment where AI directly creates and modifies files and users review and approve with Diff Preview by introducing Agent mode.      ◦ Key Features 3-Tier Chat Mode: Simple questions (Ask), planning (Plan), and agent (Agent) modes for direct file operations. How to Use • Easy Installation: Download the .vsix file from GitHub Releases and install in 5 seconds (no build required).  • Context-Awareness: Automatically recognizes the current file and supports attachment of specific files using the @ symbol.  • Agent Operations: Diff preview and accept/reject workflow for file changes.  • Slash Commands (Skills): Supports commands such as /explain, /fix, and /refactor, and extends custom skills (.tokamak/skills).  • Inline Completion: Real-time Ghost Text suggestions tailored to the code under development.  • Terminal Integration: Immediately execute terminal commands suggested by AI.  • Persistence: Maintains the context of previous work by saving chat history for each project.

| 2026-02-04 06:04:25.693000 | tokamak-dev | Hello everyone, :bows: As a *Operation Spear – Track B* deliverable, I designed a *Lottery Candidate model based on WTON staking*. :link: *Repo:* <https://github.com/tokamak-network/ton-staking-v2/tree/lotteryCandidate> :page_facing_up: *Docs:* <https://github.com/tokamak-network/ton-staking-v2/tree/lotteryCandidate/docs/LotteryCandidate/en>  What I built In the existing Candidate structure, users who stake WTON can only receive *staking rewards (seigniorage)*. This model extends that structure so that: By staking *TON &amp;* *WTON*, • Users *continue to receive the same seigniorage rewards*, and • *Simultaneously gain eligibility for Lottery-based participation*. In other words, :point_right: staking itself becomes the entry point for Lottery participation.  Core idea Reuse *already staked resources* instead of introducing new participation costs. • Lottery is just *one example*. Using the same Candidate structure, this model can be extended to: • Various *tasks* • Experimental *participation mechanisms* How to test *Contract test* ```forge test --match-contract LotteryCandidateScenarioTestFront``` *Local Front Demo* ```chmod +x run-lottery-demo.sh ./run-lottery-demo.sh``` (:warning: This may take some time.) Open: <http://localhost:5173> 1. Copy `demo-fronted/src/deployment.json` 2. Paste it into the website config You can see the test flow in the demo video below.  Feedback welcome • Whether this is a reasonable extension of the existing Candidate model • Ideas for other Candidate-based use cases beyond Lottery | 2.0 | False |
