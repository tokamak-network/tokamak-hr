## Values

---

### 1. Collaboration

To achieve meaningful outcomes, team members must collaborate effectively. At any time, you can—and should—seek help and advice from others. Everyone has the right to share their opinions on any topic. While the person in charge of the task ultimately decides how to proceed, they must always take suggestions seriously and provide clear reasons for implementing or not implementing them.

**Kindness**

Kindness doesn’t mean holding back on feedback or avoiding disagreements, these are crucial to professional growth and getting results for customers. Kindness means you make a separation between the work and the person, you can criticize someone’s work but still be respectful to the person.

**Share**

Don’t be afraid of judgement or scrutiny when sharing publicly, we all understand it’s impossible to know everything.

**Say Thanks**

Recognize the people that helped you publicly, for example in our #general channel.

**Give feedback effectively**

Giving feedback is challenging, but it’s important to deliver it effectively. When providing feedback, always make it about the work itself; focus on the work impact and not the person. Make sure to provide at least one clear and recent example.

**Negative Feedback is 1 on 1**

Give negative feedbac via One-on-one video calls are preferred.

Negative feedback is distinct from negativity and disagreement. If there is no direct feedback involved, strive to discuss disagreement in a public channel, respectfully and transparently.

**Get to know each other**

We use a lot of text-based communication, and if you know the person behind the text, it will be easier to prevent conflicts. So we encourage people to get to know each other on a personal level through informal communication, for example, Slack Huddle.

### 2. Efficiency

Efficiency means achieving meaningful results without wasting resources, time, or energy. We prioritize solutions that benefit the entire Tokamak Network ecosystem rather than focusing on a specific individual or team.

**Be respectful of others’ time**

Consider the time investment you are asking others to make with meetings and a permission process. Try to avoid meetings, and if one is necessary, try to make attendance optional for as many people as possible. Any meeting should have an agenda linked from the invite, and you should document the outcome. Instead of having people ask permission, trust their judgment and offer a consultation process if they have questions.

**Write things down**

We document everything: in the handbook, in meeting notes, in issues. We do that because “[the faintest pencil is better than the sharpest memory](https://www.quora.com/What-does-The-faintest-pencil-is-better-than-the-sharpest-memory-mean).” It is far more efficient to read a document at your convenience than to have to ask and explain. Having something in version control also lets everyone contribute suggestions to improve it.

**Self-service and self-learning**

Team members should first search for their own answers and, if an answer is not readily found or the answer is not clear, ask in public as we all should have a low level of shame. Write down any new information discovered and pay it forward so that those coming after will have better efficiency built on top of practicing collaboration, inclusion, and documenting the results.

Team members have more room to grow themselves when they are able to self-service and self-learn.

**Accept mistakes**

Not every problem should lead to a new process to prevent them. Additional processes make all actions more inefficient; a mistake only affects one. Once you have accepted the mistake, learn from it. When team members are free to accept mistakes, they can take more calculated risks.

**Managers of one**

We want each team member to be a manager of one who doesn’t need daily check-ins to achieve their goals. Team members are given the freedom to own projects and initiatives and are trusted to see them through to a successful end.

### 3. **Transparency**

Tokamak Network makes information as transparent as possible to lower the barriers to contribution and make collaboration easier.

Transparency does not simply mean making information available. Even if information exists in the handbook or other documents, it is always important to deliver it in the most appropriate manner to the people who need to understand or recognize it.

Internally, we share key information and data transparently with all employees to foster stronger alignment across the organization. If there are exceptions where certain materials are not public, the reasons and details must be clearly documented.

**Not public** 

We make information public by default because transparency is one of our values. However it is most important to focus on results. Therefore, a category of information is **public** unless there is a reason for it not to be.

**Articulate when you  change your mind** 

If you state one thing, and then change course and support a different direction, point, or outcome, articulate this. It is OK to have your position changed by new data. Articulating that an *earlier* stance is not your *current* stance provides clarity to others and encourages data-driven decision making.

**Surface issues constructively**

Be transparent to the right people (up) at the right time (when still actionable). If you make a mistake, don’t worry; correct it and **proactively** let the affected party, your team, and the CEO know what happened, how you corrected it, and how—if needed—you changed the process to prevent future mistakes.

**Findability**

Our transparency value means more than just making information accessible to all. In order to improve performance it’s important that we not only ensure information is accessible, but also ensure it flows to the correct places and is [findable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Findability) by those who need it. Focusing on information flow will ensure you, for example, utilize multi-modal communication, or that you keep your stakeholders informed of changes by posting links to Slack.

### 4. Growth

At Tokamak Network, growth is more than just career progression—it is about continuous learning, collaboration, and contributing to the larger blockchain ecosystem. We believe that individual growth fuels team success and ultimately drives industry innovation. While financial rewards are important, we seek individuals who value long-term development and the opportunity to make a meaningful impact. Tokamak Network is committed to fostering an environment where employees can grow alongside the evolving blockchain landscape, realizing both personal and collective success.

**Start**

Recognizing a need, taking action, and solving problems are all part of growth. Rather than overthinking, we believe in starting immediately while remembering that there are always teammates ready to support us. We prioritize collaboration and efficiency, enabling us to take quick action and continuously improve.

- Identify issues and propose actionable solutions.
- Take initiative to lead changes and improvements.

**Doubling**

The growth of our colleagues translates into the growth of our team, which ultimately fuels our own development. Through open communication and constructive feedback, we continuously learn from each other and accelerate collective progress. We recognize the impact of personal growth on the team and company, focusing on connecting individual achievements with team success.

- Work alongside colleagues to amplify each other’s strengths.
- Build a supportive team environment that prioritizes collective success.

**Learning & Challenge**

At Tokamak Network, joining as a developer does not mean being limited to one role—you may find yourself contributing as a researcher or even supporting HR functions, depending on the needs of the team. Our independent project-based approach often requires stepping beyond primary roles, and embracing these challenges with a willingness to try is essential.

When facing obstacles, we encourage searching for open resources, asking colleagues for insights, and proactively finding solutions. Through this process, we continuously learn and take on new challenges. We believe this mindset not only drives individual growth but also strengthens the overall capabilities of the organization.

- Embrace challenges beyond your primary role and remain open to learning.
- Seek solutions by researching available resources and collaborating with teammates.

**Personal Development:**

- Seek opportunities to expand skills and knowledge.
- Align personal career goals with the organization’s mission.
- Embrace feedback as a tool for growth.

**Ownership Mentality:**

- Approach tasks with accountability and a desire to excel.
- Focus on self-driven improvement rather than external validation.

### 5. Results

At Tokamak Network, results matter because every effort we make ultimately contributes to the blockchain ecosystem. While effort and dedication are valued, true impact is measured by tangible outcomes that align with our goals.

We celebrate successes, address areas for improvement, and actively communicate to prevent repeating mistakes. This transparent and results-driven approach enhances efficiency, accelerates growth, and ensures that all work contributes meaningfully to our mission.

**Measurable Goals**

We set clear goals and document them to track progress effectively. Defining measurable objectives enables efficient and responsible actions, ensuring that every effort contributes to meaningful results.

- Prioritize deliverables over time spent working.
- Ensure milestones and deadlines are met.
- Accept accountability for both successes and failures.

**Results Over  Hours**

We evaluate performance based on outcomes, not the time spent working. Success is not just about reaching the final goal—it also includes valuable progress made along the way. If there are meaningful intermediate results, share them actively through seminars or demos. Even a minimum viable implementation can serve as a key indicator of progress and impact.

- Focus on tangible deliverables rather than time invested.
- Share valuable progress through demos and discussions.
- Recognize the significance of incremental achievements.

**Share and Celebrate Achievements**

Regularly sharing interim results provides clarity on project progress and ensures alignment with goals. It also enhances transparency and improves workflow efficiency.

When visible achievements are made, we actively celebrate them. Expressing appreciation strengthens collaboration, and recognizing each other’s successes fosters continuous motivation and team growth.

- Share progress regularly to maintain alignment and transparency.
- Celebrate achievements to reinforce a culture of collaboration.
- Recognize contributions to sustain team motivation and growth.
