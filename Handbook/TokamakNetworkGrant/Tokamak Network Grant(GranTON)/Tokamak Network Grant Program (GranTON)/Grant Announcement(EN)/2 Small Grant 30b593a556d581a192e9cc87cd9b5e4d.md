# 2. Small Grant

## Small Grants

Small grants, **capped at $5,000**, have a streamlined application and evaluation process to deliver a decision around two weeks after submission.

A small grants application might be a good fit if **any** of the following apply to your project:

- In early stage: you've started work but are still testing assumptions or working toward a proof of concept.
- Experimental: you have an idea that's a little “out there” but potentially impactful - and the only way to find out is to try it.
- Time sensitive: you need a decision within a few weeks.
- Smaller in scope: funding request comes in under $5,000.
- Community event related: sponsorship requests for events focused on Tokamak's technology and community can also be submitted via the small grants pipeline.

> If you're feeling uncertain about anything in the application, please consider signing up for [**Office Hours](https://www.notion.so/e3c32021841a4439b0d04d63767a93b8?pvs=21)** before submitting.

1. **Activation**
    
    We sign a grant agreement, complete KYC and send funds in fiat, TON - and you get to work!
    
2. **Completion**
    
    Once you've completed work on your grant, you'll share the results in a report, blog post or video.
    

## **Requirements**

We're flexible in many ways, but we do have some hard rules for the projects we fund:

- Work funded by Tokamak grants must benefit Tokamak Network in a way that aligns with Tokamak Network's [vision](https://vision.tokamak.network/)
- Any output must be open source or otherwise freely available; for-profit companies are welcome to apply but the specific grant funded work must be non-commercial.

### **Eligibility**

We are happy to hear from all kinds of contributors who are working within our scope:

- Individuals, teams or organizations.
- Newcomers to Tokamak Network, established projects, past grantees or applicants.
- Any area of expertise - we work with developers, researchers, academics, designers, educators, communicators, community organizers, and more.
- Projects at any point in the development process: just an idea, early stages, proof of concept, or with significant progress already made. However, we do not fund past work.
- Builders of any age, origin, identity or background.

### **What is NOT eligible**

- Anything that is not legal within the jurisdiction where the work is taking place.
- Financial products (trading, investment products, lending, betting, etc).
- Projects with a planned token launch or public funding round.
- Art projects or charities that don't fit within our scope.
- Token or investment focused events.

### **Tips for submitting a great application**

The information you submit here is what we'll use to make a final decision about your grant application, so take the time to understand what we're looking for and answer the form questions thoughtfully.

When evaluating your application, we look for much more than just an explanation of the proposed work. In order to determine the potential impact on the ecosystem, we need a deeper understanding of both the “why” and the “how” of the project. Some things to keep in mind:

- **Be specific:** we want you to share your grand vision - but you also need to tell us, concretely, how you plan to achieve your goals.
- **Be thorough:** the more information you can provide in a grant application, the better. We encourage you to provide any supporting documents such as whitepapers, research papers, or slides from presentations you've given about your project.
- **Show your work:** we expect you to have made a meaningful effort to validate and refine your approach and researched what other solutions are being developed, and to be able to articulate how yours is different.
- **Dig deeper:** we want to know what problem you're trying to solve, but also why you think it's important to solve that specific problem, how solving it will benefit Ethereum and how it fits within our mission.
- **Think broader:** how does your project connect to, complement and enable the work of others? How can you make sure your work stays relevant and has a sustained impact?
- **Identify output** (what is produced) as well as outcome (what is accomplished): what will be the tangible result of your work - a research paper, a code repo, a community event, a working prototype? Who will use it, and how will they access it?
- **Be realistic:** we'll consider the funding amount you request in relation to the proposed scope of work, so go with a number that reflects what you think you'll need for the specific work in your proposal. Remember that being awarded a grant now doesn't mean you can't apply for additional funding later!

## FAQ

**Is it mandatory to apply for** [office hours](https://www.notion.so/07e1b26fb0a846799b1d3ca99b35d646?pvs=21)**?**

- We're not going to force you to do Office Hours, but for the most part, we recommend going through them before submitting your application. We don't believe that we can receive a complete application without the preliminary interaction through Office Hours.

**Is my application confidential?**

- Applications are not shared with the public. However, any information you provide may be shared with advisors in the review process, so let us know in your application if there's something you want us to keep confidential!

**Can I remain anonymous?**

- Mostly, yes. We are legally required to perform KYC before transferring funds to you, and will need to know your real identity to complete that process. However, we are happy to keep that information confidential outside of the few members of the Tokamak team involved in KYC processing, and use a pseudonym or omit your name entirely in any communications that will be visible to anyone else.

**What currency are grants paid in?**

- We can provide payment in TON or Fiat-alike currency.

**Is my for-profit company eligible for a grant?**

- Tokamak Network's ecosystem is unique in the way it embraces both entrepreneurship and collaboration, and we want to keep it that way. We believe that builders can and should be able to build a business while continuing to contribute to FOSS and public goods.
- Although we do not fund work that is intended to be monetized, we are happy to hear from for-profit entities that are building public goods. We regularly fund components or areas of work carried out by for-profit companies, as long as the specific funded work fits within our scope and remains free and open to anyone.

**Will anybody actually read my application?**

- Yes! The team meets weekly to review every submission we receive, and give careful consideration to whether the project is eligible and what we can do to support. We love learning about the amazing work people are doing in the ecosystem, even when that work is outside of our scope.

**What if I need more than $5,000?**

- Small grants have a hard limit of $5,000, but if you anticipate needing more to get to the finish line, you have options. You can apply for Project Grants, which have no funding cap. If your project is otherwise a better fit for a small grant, e.g. it's more experimental or in early stages, consider applying for a small grant for a specific component or phase of work, and we can revisit the possibility of funding additional work as you approach the finish line on your initial grant.

**What happens if I’m not awarded a grant?**

- You can also reapply in the future if you feel that something has changed. If you're considering reapplying, we recommend signing up for office hours first before restarting the application process.
