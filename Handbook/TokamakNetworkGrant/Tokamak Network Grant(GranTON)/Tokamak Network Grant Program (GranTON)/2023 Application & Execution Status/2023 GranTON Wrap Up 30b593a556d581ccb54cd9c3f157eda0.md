| Project Grant | Tokamak Devops | Q1 2023 | 3 months | The Tokamak Network development process and operations are inconsistent, resulting in similar challenges each time, maintenance and testing difficulties, and these challenges are shared by developers.

Overall, I would like to provide technical support for establishing an efficient development process and help with infrastructure design and operation. | $2,000 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak BUILD Asia | Q1 2023 | 9 months | Tokamak Network's community building in Asia.

Performing various marketing tasks related to Tokamak Network.

Searching and recruiting talent to develop the Tokamak Network ecosystem.

Conducting industry-academia cooperation related to Tokamak Network. | $105,000 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak-Optimism | Q1 2023 | 1 year | Our team reached the milestone of launching the Tokamak Network's first L2 mainnet, Titan, and we wanted to maintain Titan and create a more advanced L2 environment.

Our recent achievements can be summarized as follows:

1. Well-structured code and usage tips for the Kubernetes SDK.
2. Knowledge and experience in preventing DDoS attacks.
3. Reusability of Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
4. Deeper understanding of Geth (Go Ethereum).
5. Reduction in AWS costs.

Our team remains committed to advancing the Tokamak Network ecosystem in 2024, with a focus on achieving the long-term project goals of On-demand L2 development. 

We will continue our efforts to contribute to the growth and success of the Tokamak Network. | $150,750 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak’s zk-EVM | Q1 2023 | 1 year | Our goal is to develop zk-EVM using our SNARK protocol, to prepare to launch a new scalable rollup network in the future.

The core of this project lies in a new SNARK. We have proposed and developed our SNARK for the past year. We modified Groth16, the most succinct circuit-specific SNARK, to make it universal for EVM contracts. This is intended to develop a fast zk-EVM.

As a result of this project, we believe that we can develop a new zk-EVM that has much simpler prover and verifier complexities than other zk-EVMs. | $61,590 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Sybil-resistence | Q1 2023 | 1 year | The goal was to design the sybil-resistance algorithm to make sure it works in practice by fixing any flaws I saw in the design and running some simulations to see how the network will grow and try to predict anything that will stall the growth.

The goal of the Sybil Resistance Algorithm is to add value to the tokamak ecosystem by creating a piece of infrastructure that is both integrated with the TON stake and useful to the entire Ethereum community. | $16,360 |
| Project Grant | TONStarter | Q1 2023 | 1 year | Our goal is to launch Tokamak Network's native lauchpad TONStarter in an L2 environment.

In 2023, the direction of our project has changed from the original focus on user-friendly UX/UI development to a developer-friendly approach. 

During this process, we became aware of Tokamak Network foundation's direction, which was previously unknown to us. 

This experience helped our team set the direction of TONStarter development to better fit the Tokamak Network ecosystem.

In 2024, we have plans to launch TONStater for the New Titan's environment, making it available for developers to utilize. Additionally, we intend to work on TOSv2 policies on New Titan. | $94,260 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Economics | Q1 2023 | 1 year | Tokamak Network launched its L2 Mainnet 'Titan' in June 2023.

However, the current infrastructure, including Simple Staking, is not suitable for the L2 environment. Additionally, with competitors such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Boba Network already in the market, merely creating a layer 2 platform may not be enough to attract users.

To overcome these challenges, Tokamak Layer2 Economics team will provide infrastructure for the Tokamak Network’s L2 environment. So, our team’s plan is to convert the current TON ecosystem to layer2 friendly such as Staking & DAO. | $127,300 |
| Project Grant | Contracts-monorepo | Q1 2023 | 9 months | Making a monorepo for all the legacy contracts in order to develop and test easily. | $8,800 |
| Project Grant | Influencer Marketing | Q1 2023 | 10 months | Collaborate with influencers to create content to promote Tokamak Network, TONStarter. 

Expect to increase Tokamak Network awareness and acquire new users through this collaboration. | $9,800 |
| Project Grant | CryptoPad | Q1 2023 | 3 months | CryptoPad is a dedicated device for a crypto wallet. It is a dedicated device in that users cannot install apps of their choice. 

They can use pre-installed apps only. With other advanced security technologies, it offers strong security that prevents malicious activities on the device. On the other hand, it also offers a convenient user experience. 

Compared to hardware wallets, it is much more convenient because a regular software wallet is installed, which does not require connection of an additional device. | $50,000 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Network Bridge UX/UI | Q2 2023 | 9 months | Our team develops the Tokamak Network Bridge landing page to be more user-friendly. 

We are developing the page to be equally user-friendly in the mobile environment. | $74,370 |
| Project Grant | TONDEX | Q2 2023 | 6 months | Worked on UX planning and UI design to develop a DEX utilized in the Tokamak Network ecosystem. | $8,850 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Optimism Website | Q2 2023 | 6 months | Advertise the opening of Tokamak Optimism L2 on Tokamak Network main site.

Update Tokamak Network website create specific landing page to reflect the L2 open. | $15,000 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Uniswap V4 | Q3 2023 | 3 months | Researching UniswapV4 technology and writing articles. 

Reviewed the feasibility of developing a Tokamak Network DEX service based on this technology. | $11,000 |
| Project Grant | Fee Token | Q3 2023 | 6 months | Unlike other grant projects, our project tries to use TON directly. After our project is finished, users can use TON as a tx fee. If so, users need more TON and it makes demands for the TON | $53,490 |
| Project Grant | TONStarter 3D UX | Q3 2023 | 3 months | We have two goals. At first. We are going to develop 3D design. To satisfy various customer personas, such as custom launch with TaaS (TONStarter as a Service) concept and quick launch function that can be launched with a few clicks, we wanted to implement intuitive UX through 3D design. So, customers can easily understand the concept of launching a blockchain project through the 3D landing page that replicates the spaceport shown in the promotional video.

In addition, we are going to create Tokamak characters that will be utilized as design elements for the various kinds of the service web pages and NFTs issued by Tokamak Network going forward. | $7,600 |
| Small Grant | Promotional Video | Q1 2023 | 3 months | Tokamak has been developing L2 and other related service so far. However, customers hardly enjoy entire picture on its true beauty, such as innovative ways of fast and secure L2 network, and TONStarter as one of the easiest blockchain launch pad in the world.

So, it's the right time to consider making brand new video clips for demonstrating major services and the entire vision going forward. I already contacted an outsourced content builder and established a synopsis for this. | $6,300 |
| Small Grant | Alpha Day | Q2 2023 | 5 months | To create a Tokamak Network dashboard that aggregates into a single community dashboard. | $1,500 |
| Small Grant | International media PR project | Q2 2023 | 1 months | Promoting the Tokamak Network through international media (distributing news of the Ethereum grant and mainnet launch). | $3,190 |
| Small Grant | Titan NFT | Q3 2023 | 2 months | Titan, the first L2 mainnet of the Tokamak Network, was launched on June 30th. we came to a conclusion that producing NFT would be a good way to commemorate the launch of Titan and inform the blockchain community about the launch of the mainnet once again.

For the NFTs, we will be issuing 100 different NFTs with unique characteristics. Each NFT will have scarcity with the differentiated design and colors. Regardless of its scarcity, NFTs will only be sold at 30 TON(only TON will be accepted). The goal is to sell all NFTs, and therefore, there is no limit on the amount of NFTs that a person can buy.

Also, we plan to provide goods(e.g. T-shirt, water bottle, NFT Photo cards) for free to those who purchase NFTs. We believe using goods in real life can be another way to promote Tokamak Network. | $5,200 |

For the development of the Tokamak Network ecosystem, we looking forward to expect more participants at 2024. We ask builders to actively participate and spread the word.
