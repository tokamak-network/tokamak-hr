# Q3 2023 GranTON Application and Execution.

In Q3 2023, we've seen a lot of great participation, which has spurred the development of the Tokamak Network Ecosystem.

8 project teams applied for 7 Project Grants and 1 Small Grants, totaling over $102,000 in grants. We're very grateful for everyone's interest in the Tokamak Network Grant Program, and we'd like to take this opportunity to provide a brief overview of the projects approved in Q3 2023.

 

| Project Type | Project Name | Project Duration | Project Description | Q3 2023 Grant Amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project Grant | Tokamak-Optimism | Q1-Q4 2023 | To ensure the smooth operation of Titan, the layer 2 chain that underpins the Tokamak network ecosystem, we are
monitoring the network in real time, checking for possible problems, and making improvements. A layer 2 chain with frequent
network issues would be inconvenient for users, and they would have no incentive to make transactions that require their
real assets. It would also be a major threat to the Tokamak Network ecosystem in terms of trust. Titan has been processing
all transactions that have occurred since it opened without any issues.

We've been working on infrastructure improvements to ensure Titan runs efficiently. We applied Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
to build a consistent development and deployment flow, and abstracted common infrastructure components into reusable
modules to construct a scalable infrastructure. To check and manage assets depositing and withdrawing the Titan network in
real time, we built an event-based alarm system that can be utilized as statistical data in the this quarter. | $28,500 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Network Bridge | Q2-Q4 2023 | Users have already expressed concerns and UI updates they wish to see in an update. We take all of our user’s feedback seriously and plan to strategize solutions for not so pleasing experiences. We also have big plans to enhance our service with more informative deposit and withdraw UIs + Transaction History UI.

We plan to take the most important and compelling parts of our service and simply articulate it on our web page. The easier it is to understand, the better chance we have at capturing new users.

By taking the same ideation approach from our desktop efforts. We know mobile will pose some challenges especially with a smaller form factor, but we plan to take time to problem solve and come up with creative ways to not only make the mobile and desktop product similar, but equally as functional. | $23,000 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak’s zk-EVM | Q1-Q4 2023 | Implementing a new efficient algorithm for QAP polynomial division.

Implementing IDEN3’s batched computation method for multi-scalar exponentiation (MSM).

Optimization of Polynomial manipulations in Prove. | $12,200 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Sybil-resistence | Q1-Q4 2023 | Improvements and updates to the Scoring Circuit algorithm to better apply uniqueness scores to Ethereum network addresses. | $5,400 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Economics | Q1-Q4 2023 | The Tokamak Network has announced plans to launch a layer 2 (L2) protocol based on Optimism in the second quarter of 2023. However, the current infrastructure, including Simple Staking, is not suitable for the L2 environment. Additionally, with competitors such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Boba Network already in the market, merely creating a layer 2 platform may not be enough to attract users.

To overcome these challenges, Tokamak Layer2 Economics team will provide infrastructure for the Tokamak Network’s L2 environment. So, our team’s plan is to convert the current TON ecosystem to layer2 friendly such as Staking & DAO. | $6,000 |
| Project Grant | Fee Token | Q3-Q4 2023 | Unlike other grant projects, our project tries to use TON directly. After our project is finished, users can use TON as a tx fee. If so, users need more TON and it makes demands for the TON | $14,000 |
| Project Grant | TONStarter 3D UX | Q3-Q4 2023 | We have two goals. At first. We are going to develop 3D design. To satisfy various customer personas, such as custom launch with TaaS (TONStarter as a Service) concept and quick launch function that can be launched with a few clicks, we wanted to implement intuitive UX through 3D design. So, customers can easily understand the concept of launching a blockchain project through the 3D landing page that replicates the spaceport shown in the promotional video.

In addition, we are going to create Tokamak characters that will be utilized as design elements for the various kinds of the service web pages and NFTs issued by Tokamak Network going forward. | $7,600 |
| Small Grant | Titan NFT | Q3 2023 | Titan, the first L2 mainnet of the Tokamak Network, was launched on June 30th. we came to a conclusion that producing NFT would be a good way to commemorate the launch of Titan and inform the blockchain community about the launch of the mainnet once again.

For the NFTs, we will be issuing 100 different NFTs with unique characteristics. Each NFT will have scarcity with the differentiated design and colors. Regardless of its scarcity, NFTs will only be sold at 30 TON(only TON will be accepted). The goal is to sell all NFTs, and therefore, there is no limit on the amount of NFTs that a person can buy.

Also, we plan to provide goods(e.g. T-shirt, water bottle, NFT Photo cards) for free to those who purchase NFTs. We believe using goods in real life can be another way to promote Tokamak Network. | $5,200 |

For the development of the Tokamk Network ecosystem, we need more participants. We ask builders to actively participate and spread the word.
