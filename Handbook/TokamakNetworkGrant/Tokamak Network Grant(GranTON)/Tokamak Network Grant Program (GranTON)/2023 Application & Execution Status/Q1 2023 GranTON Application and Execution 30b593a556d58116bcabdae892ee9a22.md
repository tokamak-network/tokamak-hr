# Q1 2023 GranTON Application and Execution.

It's been three months since the launch of the Tokamak Network Grant Program GranTON, and in that time, we've seen a lot of great participation, which has spurred the development of the Tokamak Network Ecosystem.

12 project teams applied for 11 Project Grants and 1 Small Grant, totaling over $240,000 in grants. We're very grateful for everyone's interest in the Tokamak Network Grant Program, and we'd like to take this opportunity to provide a brief overview of the projects approved in Q1 2023.

 

| Project Type | Project Name | Project Duration | Project Description | Q1 2023 Grant Amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project Grant | Tokamak UniswapV3 | Q1-Q3 2023 | Deployed all Uniswap V3 contracts on the tokamak-goerli network  and setting some Uniswap V3 swap pages locally. | $4,000 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak-Optimism | Q1-Q4 2023 | Fee token modeling and developing PoC, Fast Withdraw modeling, developing basic features, Maintaining live testnet on goerli, Made components on kubernetes for primary packages cluster and serving them and Integrating block explorer(blockscout). | $44,500 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Uniswap V3 UXUI & design | Q1-Q3 2023 | Cohesive look and feel across all Tokamak Swap products (Swapper, Gateway, Pool, etc.)
Tokamak specific designs for new Uniswap V3 features.
Design & Component Library to use for future projects.
High Fidelity prototypes for demo purposes.
Zeplin files for easy implementation . | $7,900 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak’s zk-EVM | Q1-Q4 2023 | Develop zk-EVM using our SNARK protocol, to prepare to launch a new scalable rollup network in the future.

The core of this project lies in a new SNARK. We have proposed and developed our SNARK for the past year. We modified Groth16, the most succinct circuit-specific SNARK, to make it universal for EVM contracts. This is intended to develop a fast zk-EVM.

Features of our SNARK are as follows:
1) It is universal for EVM contracts.
2) The complexity of the prover and verifier per circuit size inherits Groth16. 
3) Circuits of EVM contracts can be built in a small size.
    
As a result of this project, we believe that we can develop a new zk-EVM that has much simpler prover and verifier complexities than other zk-EVMs. | $23,700 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Sybil-resistence | Q1-Q2 2023 | The goal is to create a register for Ethereum addresses, where each address on the register is assigned a ‘score’ in a sybil-resistent way. 

The score is calculated using a newly developed ‘scoring algorithm’. Due to the computation complexity of this algorithm it is not possible to run the scoring algorithm on L1, hence the system will be implemented as a L2 zkrollup.

These scores can then be used as a measure of uniqueness. Applications that require protection against sybil attacks can use this register.
    
The project uses a mechanism similar to a web-of-trust. The plan is to have a standardised way for any Ethereum address to vouch for any other Ethereum address and a deterministic way to assign a score to each Ethereum address from the resulting data. | $4,000 |
| Project Grant | TONStarter | Q1-Q4 2023 | Develop TONStarter functions including TOSv2 and improve TONStarter ecosystem. | $40,000 |
| Project Grant | Contracts-monorepo | Q1-Q2 2023 | Making a monorepo for all the legacy contracts in order to develop and test easily. | $5,000 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Economics | Q1-Q4 2023 | The Tokamak Economics team primarily focus on designing economics within the Tokamak ecosystem.

Until now, the Tokamak Economics team has been researching ways to make the ecosystem fit into the layer 2 environment. The article on MEV and TON staking v2 are examples.

In the future, developing Dapps that can either go live on the main net directly or be listed on TONStarter is possible. TON derivatives can be an option. | $47,300 |
| Project Grant | Influencer Marketing | Q1-Q4 2023 | Collaborate with influencers to create content to promote Tokamak Network, TONStarter. 
Expect to increase Tokamak Network awareness and acquire new users through this collaboration. | $9,800 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Devops | Q1-Q2 2023 | The Tokamak Network development process and operations are inconsistent, resulting in similar challenges each time, maintenance and testing difficulties, and these challenges are shared by developers.

Overall, I would like to provide technical support for establishing an efficient development process and help with infrastructure design and operation. | $2,000 |
| Project Grant | CryptoPad | Q1-Q4 2023 | CryptoPad is a dedicated device for a crypto wallet. It is a dedicated device in that users cannot install apps of their choice. 

They can use pre-installed apps only. With other advanced security technologies, it offers strong security that prevents malicious activities on the device. On the other hand, it also offers a convenient user experience. 

Compared to hardware wallets, it is much more convenient because a regular software wallet is installed, which does not require connection of an additional device. | $50,000 |
| Small Grant | Promotional Video | Q1 2023 | Tokamak has been developing L2 and other related service so far. However, customers hardly enjoy entire picture on its true beauty, such as innovative ways of fast and secure L2 network, and TONStarter as one of the easiest blockchain launch pad in the world.

So, it's the right time to consider making brand new video clips for demonstrating major services and the entire vision going forward. I already contacted an outsourced content builder and established a synopsis for this. | $6,300 |

For the development of the Tokamk Network ecosystem, we need more participants. We ask builders to actively participate and spread the word.
