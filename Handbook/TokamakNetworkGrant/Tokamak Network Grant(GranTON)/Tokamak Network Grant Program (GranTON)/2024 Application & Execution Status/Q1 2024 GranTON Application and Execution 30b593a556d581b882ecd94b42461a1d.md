# Q1 2024 GranTON Application and Execution.

Dear Tokamak Network Community,

In Q1 2024, we've seen a lot of great participation, which has spurred the development of the Tokamak Network Ecosystem.

**8 project teams applied for 8 Project Grants, totaling over $280,000 in grants.** We're very grateful for everyone's interest in the Tokamak Network Grant Program, and we'd like to take this opportunity to provide a brief overview of the projects approved in Q1 2024.

 

| Project Type | Project Name | Project Start | Project Duration | Project Description | Q1 2024 Grant Amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project Grant | Tokamak-Optimism | Q1 2023 | 2 years | The project goal is to open a Thanos Devnet in our new layer 2 network using TON as the native token. Native token refers to the token on
which the network is based. For example, Ethereum's native token is ETH. It is built based on Optimism Bedrock and supports a native
token bridge to move assets between cross layers without ETH. And we identify and handle network issues to ensure the smooth
operation of Tifor the Tokamak network. | $74,000 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak’s zk-EVM | Q1 2023 | 2 years | 1. We aim to contribute to making Ethereum viable for mass adoption.

2. Our approach explores a new area of compromising trade-offs between existing zk-rollups
(ZKR) and optimistic rollups (OR).
- For details on the trade-offs between ZKR and OR, see Vitalik’s post.

3. The expected results are as follows (in terms of the Vitalik’s performance indicators):
- Higher compatibility with EVM (than ZKR, but possibly worse than OR)
- Lower off-chain computation costs ⇒ higher transaction throughput in L2 (than ZKR, but possibly worse than OR)
- Faster, more dynamic, and predictable withdrawal to L1 (than OR, but possibly worse than ZKR)
- Lower security dependency on data availability ⇒ higher scalability in L1 (than OR, but possibly worse than ZKR) | $32,500 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Sybil-resistence | Q1 2023 ổn | 2 years | An important trend in the blockchain ecosystem is the extension from purely financial applications to others such as social and political applications.
A sybil-resistance system is a key piece of infrastructure to make this possible. The aim is to create this key piece of infrastructure in such as way that
it is integrated with TON staking and so will bring more users into the Tokamak system. | $5,400 |
| Project Grant | TONStarter | Q1 2023 | 15 months | 1. It's easy for anyone to access our network and host their own
funding.

2. Striving for a proliferation of services hosted by a diverse range of
individuals.

3. Creating advantages that benefit everyone to facilitate project
creation

4. Participation in IDO is open and fair. | $16,000 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Economics | Q1 2023 | 2 years | The Tokamak Network has announced plans to launch a layer 2 (L2) protocol based on Optimism in the second quarter of
2023. 

However, the current infrastructure, including Simple Staking, is not suitable for the L2 environment. Additionally, with
competitors such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Boba Network already in the market, merely creating a layer 2 platform may
not be enough to attract users.

To overcome these challenges, Tokamak Layer2 Economics team will provide infrastructure for the Tokamak Network’s L2
environment. So, our team’s plan is to convert the current TON ecosystem to layer2 friendly such as Staking & DAO. | $69,000 |
| Project Grant | Contracts-monorepo | Q1 2023 | 15 months | Making a monorepo for all the legacy contracts in order to develop and test easily. | $2,200 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Network Bridge UX/UI | Q2 2023 | 1 years | 1. Launch Bridge Landing Page
The Tokamak Bridge landing page acts as our sales pitch to those who are
introduced to our product. This page provides information and hopefully entices
users to make transactions on our platform, resulting in a growing user base.

2. Design Mobile Bridge UX
By developing a Tokamak Bridge Mobile experience, we’re opening our
audience to larger group of mobile users. We also provide the convenience to
swap and bridge on the go, without a laptop or desktop computer.

3. Start Mobile Bridge Development
The sooner we can start developing our mobile experience the sooner we can
get it in the hands of our users. Having a full mobile experience also adds to our
credibility as a company and our mission to grow and expand our user base. | $46,500 |
| Project Grant | Decentralized Random Beacon | Q1 2024 | 5 months | This project aims to build a service that can provide a random number for blockchain users. There are three goals for this project.

1. Open source: This project will be open source so that everyone can contribute and use it for future projects.

2. Security: The random number should be provided in a cryptographically secure way with the minimum assumptions.

3. Decentralization: The random number should be generated in a decentralized way as possible. | $25,000 |
| Project Grant | TONChat | Q1 2024 | 1 year | TONchat is a Q&A service based on the chatGPT API. Basically, It stores various kind of information
in a database and utilizes them as response materials : Smart contracts developed by Tokamak
Network and their related annotations, as well as various utilization documents formed by the
community, such as user guides and Q&A documents.

This configuration is commonly referred to as a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application.
As LLM (Large Language Model) based AI is rapidly growing, RAG is one of the application services
that utilizes LLM to overcome its limitations.
As soon as its completion, we plan to transfer all rights to the development and use of TONchat
(including commercial utilization) to the Tokamak Network community. This will allow various
knowledge and know-how generated within the community to be accumulated and easily shared,
not only for the convenience of existing users but also to remove obstacles to the influx of new
users.

TONchat has only one goal. To make the source code of Tokamak Network more accessible to the
community. | $8,000 |

For the development of the Tokamak Network ecosystem, we looking forward to expect more participants at 2024. We ask builders to actively participate and spread the word.
