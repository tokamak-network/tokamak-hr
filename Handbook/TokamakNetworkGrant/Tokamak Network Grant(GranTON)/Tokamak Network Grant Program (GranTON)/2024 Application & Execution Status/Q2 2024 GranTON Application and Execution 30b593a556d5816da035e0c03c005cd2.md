# Q2 2024 GranTON Application and Execution.

Dear Tokamak Network Community,

In Q2 2024, we've seen a lot of great participation, which has spurred the development of the Tokamak Network Ecosystem.

**9 project teams applied for 8 Project Grants and 1 Small Grant, totaling over $150,000 in Grants.** We're very grateful for everyone's interest in the Tokamak Network Grant Program, and we'd like to take this opportunity to provide a brief overview of the projects approved in Q2 2024.

 

| Project Type | Project Name | Project Start | Project Duration | Project Goals | Q2 2024 Grant Amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project Grant | Tokamak-Optimism | Q1 2023 | 2 years | We create Layer 2 networks by understanding and applying the latest technologies. It is also responsible for the
operation of the Layer 2 networks. | $36,000 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak’s zk-EVM | Q1 2023 | 2 years | We aim to contribute to making Ethereum viable for mass adoption. Our final product will be a test layer 2 network
consisting of novel approaches that have not yet been tried in any other existing project. We expect our challenge to
explore new use cases for layer 2 networks. | $8,400 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Sybil-resistence | Q1 2023 | 2 years | The final goal of the project is to build a sybil-resistance system. This will be a
key piece of infrastructure that will make many social and political applications
possible. The aim is to integrate it with TON to bring more users into the
Tokamak ecosystem. | $3,000 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Economics | Q1 2023 | 2 years | Staking & DAO are the most successful services of Tokamak Network.
However, it is not fit for the L2 environment.

The ultimate goals of Project Eco are to implement & publish to the public TON
Staking V2 and DAO V2, which can support & fit the L2 environment.

After the implementation of Staking V2 is finished, we can provide seigniorage
to the L2 sequencer and FW liquidity based on staked TON.

When the implementation of DAO V2 is finished, we can provide improved
DAO governance that fits the L2 environment. | $30,000 |
| Project Grant | Tokamak Network Bridge | Q2 2023 | 1 years | Support swap/deposit/withdraw/crosstrade for reference L2 / L2 on
demand

Support stake TON deposit to reference L2 / L2 on demand

Create independent branding for the Tokamak Bridge: URL, logo, service
name(ex. superchain) | $24,000 |
| Project Grant | Decentralized Random Beacon | Q1 2024 | 6 months | Development of minimal DRB for Titan and EVM-comptible
chains

Optimization of DRB operation costs | $25,000 |

Saving Tokamak ecosystem time & effort for doing QA works by providing
automated QA tools & codes via github repo | $8,000 |
| Small Grant | Tokamak Rollup Hub(TRH) | Q2 2024 | 3 months | Deploy custom production-grade rollups with TRH, increase network activity to
generate additional revenue (Seigniorage), and utilize advanced
configurations(custom gas fee token), and free tools for optimal control of your rollup.

In a nutshell, we aim to support the Tokamak Network vision by helping operators
with the seamless deployment of the rollup stacks (Thanos, ZK). | $3,000 |

For the development of the Tokamak Network ecosystem, we looking forward to expect more participants at 2024. We ask builders to actively participate and spread the word.
