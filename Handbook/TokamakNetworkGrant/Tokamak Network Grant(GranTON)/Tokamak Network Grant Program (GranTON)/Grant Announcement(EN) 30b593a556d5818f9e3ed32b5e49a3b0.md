# Grant Announcement(EN)

Tokamak Network provides funding and other forms of support to eligible projects working to improve Tokamak Network ecosystem. We focus on work that strengthens Tokamak's foundations and enables future builders, such as open source tooling, building blocks and libraries, research, community building, educational resources, open standards, infrastructure and protocol improvements.

### **Mission and Scope**

Tokamak Network’s support is generally directed toward enabling builders rather than end-users: strengthening Tokamak's infrastructure, expanding the range of tools available to those building on Tokamak Network Layer2 blockchain, gaining a deeper understanding of cryptographic primitives, and growing the builder ecosystem through education and community development. We're open to supporting work from people and teams of all kinds.

We don't often fund L2 dapps or front-end platforms, although this is not a hard rule and there are exceptions - for example, where an application serves as a research or educational tool, or a reference implementation of a new standard or core components of Layer2 ecosystems.

### **How we support**

Grants are direct funding, awarded following a formal application, evaluation, and input from technical advisors. Grants are not donations or equity investments. We give grants to support recipients in building things that are vital to Tokamak Network's success, without the need to commercialize their work, so that these resources remain free and open to all. Tokamak grants are separated into two categories, small grants and project grants, each with a different process and criteria.

Tokamak Grant also provides non-financial support. The Tokamak Team has many valuable resources in addition to funding: visibility; access to a massive collective knowledge base; a creative and dedicated team; connections to leading developers, researchers and community members. Our goal is to deploy these resources as impactfully as we can. If funding isn't what's needed, builders can also book an Virtual Coffee Time session for non-financial support such as project feedback or help navigating the Tokamak ecosystem.

### **Application types**

There are several ways to request support from Tokamak. Choose an application type to see which one might be a fit for you and learn more about the process.

Before submitting, please take time to understand the criteria and expectations for each type of application, as well as Tokamak's mission and scope in order to make sure you provide the appropriate information and context for us to make an informed decision on how to proceed with your application.
