# HR Activity Report - Mehdi

## Final Performance Summary
Mehdi logged 126 records, concentrated in github (46), slack (40). GitHub contributions include 1 pull request(s) (e.g., fix: address critical bugs in websocket reconnection and error handling) and 41 commit(s), showing delivery on engineering work. With 40 Slack message(s), communication and coordination appear to be a consistent part of their workflow. Documentation/ops activity is evident via 38 Notion update(s). Overall strength this period is engineering delivery and code throughput.

## Current Work Focus
Recent GitHub work centers on Commit-Reveal2 and Tokamak-AI-Layer, with changes such as new UI; front-end adjustment + agent runtime handling RPC urls + thanos deployment. Slack activity is concentrated in tokamak-dev and project-drb, indicating active coordination in those threads. Meeting analysis mentions Mehdi in sessions like DRB: PR review assignment (Suhyeon, Aryan, Mehdi, Sahil, Nam) – 2026/02/02 13:38 GMT+05:30 – Notes by Gemini…; DRB: PR review assignment (Suhyeon, Aryan, Mehdi, Sahil, Nam) – 2026/02/02 13:38 GMT+05:30 – Notes by Gemini….

## GitHub Capability Assessment (CSV)
CSV GitHub activity shows 41 commits, 1 PRs, and 4 reviews across 4 repo(s) (e.g., Commit-Reveal2, DRB-node), totaling ~513917 additions and ~10646 deletions. The GitHub-only capability signal suggests: Advanced, driven by multi-repo delivery, PR ownership, review participation. This is a code-activity view and does not measure design leadership, incident response, or mentorship.

| 2026-02-06 19:36:56.936000 | track-b-demo | I am currently building Tokamak AI Layer (TAL), an economic security and coordination layer for the AI agent economy, to be deployed on Tokamak L2s. TAL provides trustless AI agent discovery, on-chain reputation, and multi-model execution verification, all compliant with the ERC-8004 standard. Agents get NFT-based identities with ZK commitments, stake-weighted reputation scores, and validation through four trust tiers — from simple reputation checks up to TEE-attested hardware verification. The protocol uses a Commit-Reveal² randomness scheme (DRB) for fair validator selection and TON staking with slashing to keep participants honest. The frontend (demo attached) lets you browse agents, register new ones, track reputation, request validations, and manage staking — all connected to live contracts on Optimism Sepolia (for testing). Smart contracts are  fully tested (381 tests passing) alongside a TypeScript SDK for programmatic integration. Next step is the e2e workflow testing using real agents. | 2.0 | True |
