| 2026-02-07 16:19:11.566000 | track-b-demo | The video below is a test video for the AI_Tokamak agent. Users can start a conversation by mentioning AI_Tokamak in a Discord channel. Once the conversation begins, it will respond to user messages without needing to be mentioned again. The AI_Tokamak agent stores messages sent by users up to a specified size. These messages are provided as context when starting a conversation with AI_Tokamak. Conversations end when the user requests termination or after a set period of time.  I am currently working to improve the quality of responses. Additionally, I am enhancing the functionality to selectively reply to messages, even from users currently in conversation, to avoid disrupting the flow of general dialogue. Finally, I am developing a mini-game based on AppChain that combines Discord channels with ZK-VM. Most game participation and operations run on AppChain, with only the final proof for reward distribution submitted on-chain. AI_Tokamak issues game participation tickets based on users' activity history, and users can use these tickets to participate in the game and earn rewards.  PS. We're currently working on resolving an issue where links occasionally appear twice :sweat_smile: | 2.0 | True |

I believe using a verifiable, isolated environment like AWS nitro enclaves can help alleviate this problem to some extent. By making the source code and prompts public, we can verify through attestation that the container is identical to the published code. | 1.0 | True |

| 2026-02-06 21:55:15.296000 | tokamak-dev | I'm currently evaluating the qwen3-80b-next and qwen3-235b models. While qwen3-80b-next provides excellent responses, an issue was discovered where it fails to correctly recognize the language used in the “question” within a multilingual environment that alternates between Korean and English. Therefore, the currently deployed version is qwen3-235b. | 0.0 | False |
