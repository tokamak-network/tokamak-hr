It focuses on enabling transparent and value-backed token creation. The core idea is to allow users to deploy ERC-20 tokens that are directly backed by the native TON token, ensuring that every newly created token has intrinsic value and immediate liquidity at launch.  The platform will standardise the entire token lifecycle, including token creation, backing mechanics, issuance, and initial distribution.
