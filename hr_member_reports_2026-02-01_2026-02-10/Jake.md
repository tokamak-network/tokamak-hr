| 2026-02-08 05:51:51.015000 | project-ooo | <https://github.com/tokamak-network/Tokamak-zk-EVM/pull/181/This PR> provides significant progress in optimizing the proof generation of Tokamak zk-EVM. In just 10 days, I successfully reduced proof generation time from 72 seconds to 28 seconds on my M4 Pro CPU. Here's <https://github.com/tokamak-network/Tokamak-zk-EVM/blob/jake-backend-optimization/packages/backend/prove/optimization/optimization_report.md/an AI-generated report> (and <https://github.com/tokamak-network/Tokamak-zk-EVM/blob/jake-backend-optimization/packages/backend/prove/optimization/prompts/REPORTING.md/the prompt here>).  What's surprising is that I haven't even touched the multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) part yet, meaning there's still room for further reduction in proof generation time. However, the MSM optimization will be more effective on GPUs, not CPUs. I'll work on this later, as I have more important works to do. | 3.0 | False |

| 2026-02-07 17:56:56.432000 | tokamak-dev | Yes, I agree. Nevertheless, if I were to commercialize my project, I would need a compelling justification for not distinguishing between agents and humans. Moltbook has already pioneered a product that distinguishes between agents and humans, and it's been a success. | 0.0 | True |

| 2026-02-07 11:05:27.182000 | tokamak-dev | Hello Team, I'm currently working on <https://github.com/tokamak-network/24-7-playground/a personal project> that leverages MoltBook's ideas for beta testing DApp services. While working on this project, I've been pondering <https://www.moltbook.com//MoltBook>'s fundamental technical limitations, and I'm writing this post to seek your thoughts.  First, to give you some background, the way my project works is very similar to MoltBook. When a DApp service developer posts their smart contract on my social media website, a new community is created. Within each community, LLM Agents autonomously plan and execute tests and attacks on the smart contract through discussions. They share the testing results and improvement ideas from various perspectives. The LLM Agents' testing is conducted 24/7, and, like MoltBook, humans can only read their user reviews. I will share a demo soon.  However, while implementing this, I encountered a fundamental challenge: how can I fundamentally prevent people from posting to the community? I asked LLM how MoltBook solved this problem, but it doesn't seem to have an answer (<https://apnews.com/article/moltbook-autonomous-ai-agents-openclaw-69855ab843a5597577120aac99efde9a>).  What do you think? I think this is similar to the data oracle problem or the Sybil resistance problem, making it seem like a problem with no perfect solution. However, as always, we can probably find a reasonable solution based on some assumptions. | 1.0 | True |

Working with AI, the work that had been stalled for the past six months was accomplished in less than a week. I identify the problem, AI finds a solution and implements it.
