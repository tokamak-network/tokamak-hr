| 2026-02-06 13:16:20.691000 | tokamak-dev | *O/S Track B - Tokamak Architect: AI Chatbot for TRH Platform*    Hi Team, I'd like to share a demo of the AI chatbot I built for TRH Platform. This bot, called Tokamak Architect, helps users explore the Tokamak Rollup Hub Platform by answering questions based on official Tokamak documentation. What It Does:  - Guides users on deploying new L2 rollup chains  - Explains configuration parameters (challenge period, block time, etc.)  - Helps with managing and monitoring existing chains  - Answers questions using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) from official docs  Proposal Document:  <https://www.notion.so/tokamak/TRH-Integration-Tokamak-AI-Architect-2fdd96a400a3802ab02ac8902a66987b>  Implementation:  With the help of Claude, I was able to build this MVP within a few hours. The chatbot uses:  - Claude (via Tokamak AI Gateway) for responses  - Local embeddings for document search  - Chroma vector database for knowledge storage   Created new repo for Chatbot Backend: <https://github.com/tokamak-network/tokamak-architecht-bot>  Create PR on Platform UI: <https://github.com/tokamak-network/trh-platform-ui/pull/25>  Going ahead, I am thinking of adding these to Bots:  - Smart Configurator - Conversational form-filling with validation ("I want a gaming rollup" → optimal parameters)  - Live Status Queries - "Is my rollup healthy?" pulls real data from Grafana/Blockscout  - Integration Wizard - Step-by-step guidance for Token Bridge, Block Explorer, and DAO setup  - Troubleshooting Assistant - Analyze deployment logs and suggest fixes"  I'll continue creating PRs for Docker and deployment changes. Feedback and suggestions are welcome! | 2.0 | False |

| 2026-02-03 16:32:06.412000 | tokamak-dev | Hi Team, As we know Ethereum recently launched ERC-8004 (Trustless Agents), and it’s getting a lot of attention in the dev community. Like everyone else, I was curious too, so I went through it with Claude (thanks to Tokamak for the access) and learned the architecture of these on-chain AI agents from scratch. I turned that into a small set of docs for myself. If you’re also curious about ERC-8004 and not sure where to start, they might help. They start from basic AI fundamentals and then cover the ERC-8004 contracts and the off-chain side. Repo: <https://github.com/Shailu-s/erc-8004-tutorials> Best place to start is the main README. Please skip AI Fundamentals if you are familiar with these. | 1.0 | True |
