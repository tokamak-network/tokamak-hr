Send payments to anyone without exposing their  wallet history. Every payment goes to a fresh, unlinkable one time address.   *What* *it* *does* • *ERC-5564* *+* *ERC-6538* stealth addresses on Thanos • *.tok* naming — register yourname.tok, share that instead of a raw address • Custom payment links — invoice.yourname.tok for specific use cases • PIN-based stealth keys — no extra seed phrases, just 6-digit PIN + wallet signature • Sponsored gas — recipients claim funds without holding native tokens • Real-time inbox — scans chain for incoming stealth payments automatically *Where* *this* *can* *go* *TRH* *Platform* *integration* — stealth payments as a native feature inside TRH. Users get private receive addresses   out of the box, no separate app needed. Every TON transfer on the platform could optionally route through  stealth addresses for privacy. *AI* *agent* *payments* — with protocols like x402 enabling autonomous agent-to-agent payments, stealth addresses  become the missing privacy layer. An agent SDK with headless key management + scanner would let agents receive  and claim payments without a UI, and without leaking their entire tx history on-chain. *Cross-chain* *stealth* — the ERC-5564/6538 standard is chain-agnostic. Same .tok identity could resolve stealth  addresses on any EVM chain Tokamak supports. | 1.0 | True |
